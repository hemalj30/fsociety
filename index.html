            <p><b>Fsociety</b> is the name of a hacker group based in Coney Island, New York, led by the mysterious Mr. Robot.The group is highly secretive, electing to meet and communicate in person, rather than
                through digital means which may be traceable. fsociety is responsible for the massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack
                 that took E Corp offline before Elliot stopped them.
                  After the attack ended, Elliot found a file left on
                   one of the E Corp servers by fsociety. Rather than delete the file,
                    Elliot changed the access permissions on the file to allow only
                     himself access to it. Later, he was approached by Mr. Robot on 
                     the subway, and taken to Coney Island to see the group's headquarters.</p>
